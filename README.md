# Sigi

Sigi is an organizational tool.

It's primarily intended for you to use as extra memory. Use it to organize your
tasks, groceries, or the next board games you want to play.

# Examples

# Motivation

_Sigi_ is the [Chamorro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chamorro_language) word
for _continue_. I hope it will help you to plan more, forget less, get things
done, and relax. ðŸŒ´

There's [a limit](https://wiki.c2.com/?SevenPlusOrMinusTwo) to human memory, and
remembering things uses up [willpower](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/307740/willpower-by-roy-f-baumeister-and-john-tierney/).
I like working at a command line, and wanted a tool to free me up from trying to
juggle tasks and ideas. I also just like stacks, and stack-based languages like
[Forth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forth_(programming_language)) and
[Factor](https://factorcode.org) are such a joy to play with.
